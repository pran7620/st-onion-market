# st-onion-market

This Streamlit script is designed to create an interactive web application for visualizing yearly market data using a CSV file. Let's break down the code and its functionality:

Import Libraries:

streamlit: Streamlit is used to create web applications.
pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib.pyplot: Matplotlib is used for creating plots.
pandas.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters: This registers converters for Pandas to work better with Matplotlib.
Streamlit Title:

st.title(): Sets the title of the Streamlit web application.
Read Data:

pd.read_csv(): Reads a CSV file ('satana.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame (df).
Data Preprocessing:

The script converts specific columns to datetime objects to ensure proper handling of dates.
Year Selection Dropdown:

st.selectbox(): Creates a dropdown widget for selecting the year.
Based on the selected year, it sets the variables x_col, y_col, and title for plotting.
Plotting:

sns.lineplot(): Creates a line plot using Seaborn. It takes the selected year's data from the DataFrame df and plots it with a red line and markers.
plt.xlabel(): Sets the x-axis label.
plt.ylabel(): Sets the y-axis label.
plt.title(): Sets the plot title.
plt.xticks(rotation=45): Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.
plt.legend(): Shows the legend on the plot.
plt.grid(True): Displays a grid on the plot.
Display the Plot:

st.pyplot(plt): Displays the Matplotlib/Seaborn plot in the Streamlit app.
Overall, this Streamlit app allows the user to select a year from a dropdown menu, and it dynamically generates a line plot showing the maximum price data for the selected year. The plot is displayed within the Streamlit app, making it interactive and user-friendly. Users can explore different years of market data visually.
